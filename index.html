          These are some of the projects from my course that I completed during my first few months of coding. 
          I started learning the basics of HTML and CSS in my spare time through an online coding camp, and although
          I don't think there is anything particularly noteworthy, I've come to think of it as more of documenting an ongoing journey.
          There is so much more to go, I'm enjoying the process immensely.

          So the next phase is JavaScript. 
          I'm currently enrolled in a fundamentals of JS course from Syracuse University.
          After learning the very basics, like, what is a website to how can I make a website look nice, and onto how can I make it more comfortable and intuitive to use?
          It should be exciting.

          I would like to take the time to shout out the programs that have helped me along the way.
          All my HTML and CSS Basics have come straight from Angela Yu's Course available on <a href=" https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?couponCode=ST14MT101024">udemy.com</a>
          And I would like to thank The Onward to Opportunity Program at Syracuse University for their JS Basics Course.
